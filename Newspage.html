                    Mr Garg encouraged his employees to use the AI language tool for the agency’s long list of daily tasks, from coming up with story ideas for clients, pitches to offer the media, and transcribing meeting and interview notes.

                <p>A US federal judge has ruled that Google must allow Android apps made by rival technology firms onto its Google Play app store for three years starting next month.

                    The change was among several remedies ordered by Judge James Donato in a case brought against Google by Epic Games, the maker of the hit video game Fortnite.
                    
                    Google says it will appeal against the decision and ask for a pause to the proposed remedies.
                    
                    In December, a jury sided with Epic, which says Google stifled competitors by controlling the distribution of apps and payments on Android phones.</p>
